New in future versions
- Replace callback functions by promises?
- Avoid flashing?
- Move configurations from context to configuration object?
- Add if: expression (example-> if: isImportant 'important' is equals to cond: isImportant 'important' '')?
- Add data-telse and data-telse-condition tags?
- Add data-tswitch expression and data-tcase expression?
- Implement adquisition?

New in 0.41.0
- Add options.registerComponent?
- Add support of components. Components must implement these methods:
    - beforeProcessing()
    - afterProcessing()
    - getTemplate( viewId ) ?

New in 0.40.0
- Add options.reactive (boolean) to activate or deactivate the reactive behaviour in a full render command?

New in 0.39.0
- Add options.macro (string) to set the name of the macro to invoke in a full render command?

New in 0.38.0
- New configuration option added: goToURLHash. It is a boolean value (default to true the first execution of ZPT, the rest executions are default to false). If it is true ZPT-JS updates the location.href to the current URL hash. This is needed because normal behaviour does not work, ids generated by ZPT-JS are not available when the browser try to use the URL hash.

New in 0.37.1
- Bug fixed: an error occurs when strict mode is set to true and a var is defined using tal:define.

New in 0.37.0
- Removed jquery dependency in non dev.
- Jquery expressions replaced by query expressions.
- Bug fixed: jsdom dependency added.
- Added support to run tests using the console:
    - npm run testBrowser   // Run the related to browser tests
    - npm run testNode      // Run the related to node.js tests
    - npm run test          // Run all tests

New in 0.36.1
- Dependencies updated.
- Replaced node-jsdom dependency by jsdom due it is no longer maintained (install of ZPT-JS failed using some recent versions of node).

New in 0.36.0
- Added new command: update.
- Added options.updatedDictionary (object) to set the list of properties to bind.

New in 0.35.0
- Added new tag: data-declare. It declares a list of items, each item is a variable name, a variable type (optional) and a default value expression (optional too). Optionally a 'required' suffix can be added. A strict mode is set to true inside the node with this attribute.
- Added some methods to context:
    - setStrictMode( strictMode ). Set the value of strictMode (default value is false). If it is set to true all variables must be declared; if ZPT-JS finds a non declared variable in an expression an error occurs.
    - isStrictMode(). Get the value of strictMode.
- Variable expression must match a regular expression. It is defined by zpt.context.getConf().variableNameRE and it is /^[A-Za-z0-9_/-]+$/ by default.
- errorFunction method of Context now is invoked when any error occurs except if the error is related to async preloading (in this case the asyncError method is invoked).
- Added a prefix to private vars to avoid name collision: '_'. The renamed vars are:
    - onErrorVarName:          "_on-error",
    - onErrorStructureVarName: "_on-error-structure",
    - i18nDomainVarName:       "_i18nDomain"
    - i18nLanguageVarName:     "_i18nLanguage"
    - externalMacroUrlVarName: "_externalMacroUrl"
    - strictModeVarName:       "_strictMode"
    - declaredVarsVarName:     "_declaredVars"
    - repeatVarName:           "_repeat"

New in 0.34.0

    - talAttributes:    "data-attributes"
    - talContent:       "data-content"

New in 0.29.0
- Save every scope into a cache, set an id to it and put it in HTML using a data-tscope tag to make it easy to re-render.
